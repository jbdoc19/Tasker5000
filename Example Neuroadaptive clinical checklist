This neuroadaptive checklist is designed by applying principles of ADHD-optimized UI/UX architecture and task management systems—such as those centered on externalizing executive function, providing immediate dopamine-driven feedback, prioritizing low-friction execution, and segmenting overwhelming tasks.

Example- Thursday
AM- i see patients at st pjs with a resident
pm- administrative time

narrative: My schedule tomorrow and my current taskload: clinic - i will see 5 patients with residents in the morning (note* residents see the patients first and then present to me. They then complete the medical chart, and I review their note. I'm able to continue working while they see patients). Notes for these patients must be done before 1 pm. I have administrative time in the afternoon noon to 5pm, but to pick up my son at 3 pm. I currently have pending tasks: 150 patient charts, 29 patient calls, 52 labs to review.


The plan is structured around the hard stop (3 PM pick-up) and the immediate clinic deadline (1 PM notes).

## 🌅 Morning Focus & Mandatory Completion (Clinic: Until 1:00 PM)

The priority in this phase is achieving the *mandatory quick win* of completing the 5 patient notes before the 1 PM deadline, while leveraging the passive time during resident charting for high-friction backlog tasks.

### 🎯 Pre-Clinic Activation (Neuro-Priming)

| Task | Adaptive Strategy (Why it works) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Morning Routine Launch** | Run an abbreviated "AM Start" routine to flood dopamine and anchor intentions. Log current energy/restfulness level (e.g., using the $ENERGY\_LABELS$ scale). | |
| **2. Distraction Control** | Activate Focus Mode/Distraction Filters to create a "flow corridor," masking non-urgent notifications and side menus. Use noise-canceling headphones. | |
| **3. Externalize Prioritization** | Designate the 5 clinic notes (due by 1 PM) as the "Due Today" priority. This high-urgency task acts as a **Persistent Spatial Anchor** or "magnet zone" for attention. | |

### 💡 Concurrent Work Flow (While Residents Chart)

Since residents see patients first and you can continue working, this block is optimally used for tasks that suffer from **initiation inertia** but benefit from low-cognitive load and batch processing.

| Batch Task (Focus Target) | Adaptive Strategy (Why it works) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Batch Review: Labs** (52 pending) | Use the **Cluster & Batch Genie** approach to group all 52 labs together, minimizing the energy lost to constant context-switching. | |
| **2. Batch Execution: Quick Calls** (29 pending) | Dedicate a time chunk (e.g., a 25-minute Pomodoro) to rapid-fire the easiest patient calls. This leverages the stimulating environment of the clinic waiting for resident presentations. | |
| **3. Mandatory Note Review** (5 patients) | When the resident's charts are ready, these tasks should be categorized as high **Time to Start** (pre-filled by resident = value 4 or 5) and should be quick: "review and sign only". Use the preset Chart Template Steps (e.g., `Review/modify A/P`, `Sign off`) for consistency and to externalize memory. | |

## ⏰ Afternoon Backlog Attack (Admin: 12:00 PM – 3:00 PM)

This limited 3-hour administrative block is where **ruthless triage** is necessary to tackle the 150-chart backlog. Success depends on focusing on the *Next Best Thing* to maximize gains before the 3 PM hard stop.

### 🎯 Triage & Visualization (12:00 PM - 12:30 PM)

| Task | Adaptive Strategy (Why it works) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Emergency Triage** | Run the **Rapid Relief Planner** on the 150 charts / 29 calls / 52 labs. Input the 3-hour working window (12 PM–3 PM) to ruthlessly prioritize what must be done *now* and what to drop or delay. Delegate prioritization to the system to reduce executive dysfunction and decision fatigue. | |
| **2. Visual Timeline** | Generate an **Adaptive Gantt Artisan** snapshot for the "Next 3-hour block". This visual aid combats time blindness and ensures you only schedule tasks that *actually fit* before 3 PM. | |
| **3. Emotional De-Weighting** | Use the **Comedic Reframing Coach** to rename the chart backlog (e.g., "Operation: Slay the Paperwork Hydra"). This injects humor to reduce the emotional barrier and task aversion associated with high-volume, boring work. | |

### 📈 Execution Sprints (12:30 PM - 3:00 PM)

Focus on maximizing chart completion momentum.

| Action Block (150 Charts Target) | Adaptive Strategy (Why it works) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Find the Low-Friction Start** | Start with the single task identified by the AI as having the highest focus score (easiest win/highest interest/closest deadline). Filter charts by **Time to Start = 5** ("Review and sign only") to quickly secure an initial win and build **Momentum Protocol**. | |
| **2. Chart Sprint: Micro-rewards** | Engage the **LLM Focus Buddy** for 2-3 timed Pomodoro sprints (e.g., 25 minutes of focused charting followed by a mandatory 5-minute break). Ensure the system provides **Immediate Dopaminergic Feedback** (e.g., animated checkmarks or points) for each signed chart. | |
| **3. Interruption Recovery** | If interrupted (e.g., a non-urgent patient call/ping), use the **One-Touch Task Re-entry** ("jumpback" feature) to instantly return to the exact step you were on, minimizing context loss penalty. If severe conflict occurs, engage the Working Memory Reset Cue (e.g., a quick walk or stretch to harness the **doorway effect**). | |
| **4. Hard Stop Action** | At 2:50 PM, perform a **Defuse Action**. Stop the current task regardless of completion and execute the *next best thing* (e.g., prepare the Launch Pad for tomorrow, grab keys). This action, taken despite feeling unfinished, is an intentional choice to honor the 3 PM commitment. | |

## 💡 Systemic Strategies for the Backlog

To manage the persistent cognitive load of the 150 charts, 29 calls, and 52 labs, ongoing strategies rooted in systems-thinking are essential:

*   **Tackling the Chart Backlog (150 Charts):** Continually rely on **Dynamic Task Clustering**. Sort charts not just by due date, but by factors that reduce mental effort, such as:
    *   **Clinic Site** (e.g., St PJ’s Shelter or Craniofacial Clinic charts get a priority boost if done on the day of service).
    *   **Patient Type** (e.g., batch all "Non-Complex" charts together for quick, low-effort wins).
    *   **Ease of Start** (charts marked as "Mostly drafted or pre-filled by a resident" are prioritized first, as they are closest to completion).

*   **Handling Patient Calls (29 Calls):** Integrate the LLM as an external executive coach. Use the **Notion Kanban Autopilot** to log call tasks into a visually structured board, ensuring no task falls into the memory gap. For high-stakes calls, use a **Social Script Rehearsal** LLM to practice clear boundary-setting language or tone (e.g., to quickly triage if the call is urgent or can wait).

*   **Preventing Overwhelm:** Adopt a **Systems-Thinking Approach** by continuously modifying processes to work on the "worst day," not relying on peak motivation. If a moment of deep anxiety or meltdown occurs due to the magnitude of the backlog, trigger the **Meltdown Shield Protocol** to de-escalate anxiety and radically reduce the scope of work to a single, achievable task.
