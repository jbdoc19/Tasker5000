## Sprint 0 Goal
Deploy /compute_etaH endpoint and confirm that system:
- Accepts physical and mental state input
- Calculates Esustain, Scommit, Sopen, Sstart, Ftask
- Returns ηH and mode band (Recovery → Unicorn)
- Outputs correct controls based on ηH

## Sprint 0 Status
🟢 /compute_etaH live via Replit
🟢 Inputs validated manually via Postman/browser
🟢 Mode switching verified
